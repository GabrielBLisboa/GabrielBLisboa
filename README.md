Hello!

In october 2022, I was selected to participate in a Test Automation bootcamp promoted by <b> Santander and Ada Tech </b>. I was one of 75 selected in a process that counted with more than 5 thousand applications. 

With the training now finished, without ever having stopped studying, I'm now feel ready to start a new journey working as a <b> Backend Developer </b> (Java) or as a  <b> QA Analist </b> (Selenium/Cucumber).

Currently I work as college professor at Centro Universitário Senac in São Paulo and have worked or taught filmmaking and communication studies for the last six years.

Before that I have graduted with a technical degree in computer programming and have worked as an IT support. So I'm no strange to the tech world and still have many friends in the area!

Here are some assignments or projects of my own.
