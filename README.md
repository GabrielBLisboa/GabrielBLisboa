I'm pursuing a change in my career to focus in QA and Automated Tests working mainly with Java, Selenium and Cucumber. 

I work as college professor at Centro Universitário Senac in São Paulo and have worked or teach filmmaking and communication studies for the last seven years.

In high school I have graduted with a technical degree in computer programming and have worked as an intern mainly working with IT support. 
So I'm no strange to the tech world and still have many friends in the area.
