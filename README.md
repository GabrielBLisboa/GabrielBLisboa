Hello!

In october 2022, I was selected to participate in a QA bootcamp promoted by Santander and Ada Tech. I was one of 75 selected in a process that counted with more than 5 thousand applications. 

With the training now finished I'm pursuing a change in my career to focus in QA and Automated Tests working mainly with Java, Selenium and Cucumber. 

Currently I work as college professor at Centro Universitário Senac in São Paulo and have worked or taught filmmaking and communication studies for the last seven years.

Before that I have graduted with a technical degree in computer programming and have worked as an intern mainly working with IT support. 

So I'm no strange to the tech world and still have many friends in the area!

Here are some class assignments or projects of my own.
